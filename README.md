# PokemonSwift
An example of SwiftUI working with the Pokemon API. I set up an MVVM with SwiftUI to fetch and display the list of the first 150 pokemon from the 1st generation (The best generation ðŸ˜ƒ). Clicking on a pokemone will display a detailed view with the pokemon's abilities and moves. Enjoy!!
